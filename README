Six degrees of Kevin bacon game, implemented on a graph.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon

Starter code for Kevin.java is written by Peter Froehlich (http://gaming.jhu.edu/~phf/)
Everything in the solveBacon() method is my own, everything else is his. I wrote the rest of the classes.

Given a data set (two are included), and an actor, the program sees how many degrees of
separation there are between the actor and Kevin Bacon. Kevin Bacon has a bacon number of 0,
somebody who has acted in a movie with him has a bacon number of 1, somebody who has
acted in a movie that has an actor that acted with him has a number of 2, and so on and so forth.
It is posited that no (recent) actor has more than six degrees of separation with him.

Usage:
	java Kevin [data file name] ["actor name"]
Example:
	java Kevin action06.txt "De Rosselli, Rex"
Output:
	De Rosselli, Rex
	Lion's Claws, The (1918)
	Brinley, Charles
	Adventure in Sahara (1938)
	Lawrence, Marc (I)
	Big Easy, The (1987)
	Goodman, John (I)
	Death Sentence (2007)
	Bacon, Kevin

Please note that running it on a large data set can take up to a minute.
